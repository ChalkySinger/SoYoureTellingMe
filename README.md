# SoYoureTellingMe
 So you're telling me a shrimp fried this rice?

 A 3D cooking game where you play as a shrimp chef from the future, sent back in time to reduce the shrimp population by making shrimp fried rice.
 Played using a custom controller powered by an Arduino, flip the pan, turn the heat dial, and select ingredients with the joystick to make your delicious shrimp dish!

 Created for the Installation Development Project module by Justin Ward, Harry Hall and Ranen Fernandes during Term 2 of Second Year.
